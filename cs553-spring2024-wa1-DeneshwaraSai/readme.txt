The solution to question 1 is available in the report.pdf file from pages 1 to 7.
The solution to question 2 is available in the report.pdf from pages 8 to 38.

The solution to question 3 is available in the report.pdf from pages 39 to 42.
The solutions to question 3 are in bash scripts and Python programming languages. 
	3) a) 
    Solution is available in the “disk-benchmark-background.sh” file. 
    This file needs an executable mode to run; therefore, use the below command in any terminal : 
    ** chmod +x disk-benchmark-background.sh 
    To get the output, use the command 
    ** sh disk-benchmark-background.sh
    The file disk-benchmark-background-log.txt is automatically created during the execution and output is seen during and after the process of execution.

    3) b) 
    Solution is available in the "network-test.sh" file. It is mandatory to create a file text file called network-test-machine-list and add a few domains like (www.google.com, www.youtube.com, etc). Give the executable command to the network-test file and run the file by using "sh network-test. sh". You can see the domain name and its average Round trip time in the output file network-test-latency.txt. It is separated into a single space.
    ** chmod +x sh network-test. sh - gives permission for execution
    ** sh network-test.sh - to get output.

    3) c) 
    It takes the network-test-latency.txt as input and execution is done in network-test-matplotlib.ipynb file. 
        It created graphs respective to the domain name and its average RTT.


The solution to question 4 is available in the report.pdf from pages 43 to 49.
